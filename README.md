# alteryx-customer-sales-report
This project automates the preparation of a customer-level sales report by integrating customer master data with transactional sales data using Alteryx Designer. The workflow cleans, filters, aggregates, and joins data from multiple sources to generate a ranked Top-10 customer sales report, exported as an Excel file for business reporting.
